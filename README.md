🌿 Plant Disease Prediction Using CNN
A web-based application that helps farmers and agriculturists detect plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

🔍 Overview
This project uses deep learning to classify plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. It aims to assist in early detection of plant diseases, improving crop yield and reducing the use of pesticides.
